# To Do list

* Positive confirmations of all commands unless quiet mode
* Command line verbosity control
* TLS support
* Docker / Compose file build from selection of components
* Rename command
* check capabilities and not just root user
* view / tail logs
* list / status in CSV and LSON formats
* REST API for remote - initially read-only + rate limited
* command should show user information.
* SAN configuration support
* Handle spaces in instance names - as per "Demo Gateway" ... sigh
  Replace space with another character? '+' but not '_' or '-' as they are common in names
  Search and replace directories and file names in/out or just display and arg parsing?
